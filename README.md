# Main concerns right now:

1) When do we want to verify/update if the user is still subscribed?
2) When do we want to verify if the creator has respected his update schedule?
3) Do we want to do the previous two on the backend (just view the values for free, calculate and then do the changes in the blockchain) or on-chain)?
